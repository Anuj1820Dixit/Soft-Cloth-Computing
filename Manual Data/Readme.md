# Plain Cloth Image Dataset (Manual Collection)

This repository contains a manually collected dataset of **soft cloth images** captured in the **plain (spread out)** state across various surfaces and lighting conditions. The dataset serves as a foundation for developing cloth detection and classification systems using computer vision techniques.

## üß© Dataset Purpose

Cloth state detection is a complex computer vision problem due to cloth deformability, lighting conditions, and surface textures. This project addresses the **early-stage challenges of data scarcity and realism** by collecting actual images of cloth in the **plain state** before transitioning to synthetic data generation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Background

**We were initially awaiting the arrival of a depth camera** to build a more advanced dataset using **Blender-generated synthetic scenes** with accurate 3D information. However, **to begin experimentation early**, we manually collected image data by **clicking photos of soft cloth** in real environments. This allowed us to:

- Begin testing TensorFlow pipelines
- Validate image preprocessing and labeling strategies
- Evaluate surface and lighting variation effects on cloth detection
